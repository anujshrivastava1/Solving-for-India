# Disease Prediction using KNN, Flask and React JS

This web application uses a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) model to predict the likelihood of a patient having a specific disease based on their symptoms. The model is trained on a dataset of patient symptoms and disease diagnoses.

## Features

- Input symptoms and get a prediction of the likelihood of various diseases using a KNN model
- See a list of the top symptoms for each disease
- Simple and easy-to-use user interface

## Technologies Used

- React JS
- Python
- Flask
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn

## Getting Started

To get started with the web app:

1. Clone this repository
2. Install the necessary dependencies: `npm install` and `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Start the Flask server: `python server.py`
4. Start the React app: `npm start`

## Usage

Once the app is up and running, simply input your symptoms and click "Submit" to get a prediction of the likelihood of various diseases. You can also view the top symptoms associated with each disease.
